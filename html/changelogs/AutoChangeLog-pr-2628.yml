changes:
  - balance: The BSA now goes kaboom when relayed instead of being essentially a ghost
      NAC shell.
  - bugfix: The Eclipse no longer spawns a borg module that should never exist outside
      of mobs.
  - bugfix: DNA no longer has some super weird code for flavor text, instead copying
      the one of the source mob.
  - tweak: You can no longer stack interactions on walls. This is to prevent a runtime
      from actions that modify the type of them (deconstruction mainly).
  - bugfix: Paper no longer runtimes if you do not have a pen in hand (???).
  - bugfix: Traders no longer do some cursed things to create their trade items, instead
      using the all-powerful initial().
  - bugfix: The stormdrive no longer runtimes if it has zero gas in it.
  - bugfix: Some squad assignment stuff shouldn't try to use a list as datum anymore.
