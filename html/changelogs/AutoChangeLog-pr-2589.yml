changes:
  - rscadd: Overmap singularities now have more impactful effects, including but not
      limited to increased gravity inside nearby vessels, dampener interference, and
      improved directional pull.
  - rscadd: Full hardsuits now provide 1G gravity protection against damage, though
      they do not improve movement.
  - balance: Silicons will suffer from consistently very high gravity, starting at
      above 8G.
  - tweak: Some interactions with high gravity previously limited to grav-sensitive
      individuals now are accessible to anyone, albeit at lower magnitude (generally
      3G higher tolerance)
  - bugfix: Starsystem persistence should now be slightly less volatile.
  - config: The starsystem persistence config MUST be reset to the default starmap
      for the fixes in this PR to apply correctly.
