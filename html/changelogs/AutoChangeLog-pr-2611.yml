changes:
  - tweak: Rerouted the piping network in the assault course a bit so it resolves
      the issue raised about them missing when they were actually going through the
      window instead.
  - rscdel: Removed some wiring that didn't do anything.
  - bugfix: Engineering Lobby now has the wiring coming from maintenance actually
      hooked up to the grid rather than ending a tile early.
